# CHIP8 Emulator

My first attempt at emulation. This Go project aims to emulate a fully working CHIP8 system complete with graphics, a working CPU, memory, sound, and keyboard input.

Currently, it is ridden with bugs and I suspect the problem lies in the CPU. Memory and stack seem okay, but for some reason the registers and video memory seem to be broken.

Audio currently not implemented.
